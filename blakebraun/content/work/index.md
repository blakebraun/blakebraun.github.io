Through my internship experience at [DISH](http://dish.com), I was able to teach myself the fundamentals of JavaScript, React, Redux, and Radium. I thoroughly enjoy working with front-end development and have a strong interest in pursuing these languages and frameworks further. In addition, learning more about REST APIs allowed me to gain a greater understanding of web service architecture, and I hope to continue to expand this knowledge in my near future.

As the Vice President of Administration for the Delta Delta chapter of the Alpha Phi Omega service fraternity, I completely redesigned the [chapter website](http://apo.slu.edu), making it more visually appealing and easier to navigate.

In addition, I also maintain the [Alpha Phi Omega - Delta Delta Facebook page.](http://facebook.com/apodeltadelta)

As a [‘Be a Billiken Blogger’](http://www.slu.edu/beabilliken/be-a-billiken-blog) for Saint Louis University’s Division of Marketing & Communications, I provide a current student’s perspective on undergraduate life at the University for prospective students.

For a newswriting course, I maintain a [blog](http://blakebraun.wordpress.com) related to topics in the university community as well as general tips on newswriting as a practice.

In addition, for fun, I created a [Snapchat filter](img/filter.jpg) that is active on the campus of Saint Louis University.
